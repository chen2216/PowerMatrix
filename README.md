## About PowerMatrix Project
I started this project last semester. This project is mainly to solve various matrix problems mostly for MA265 class. I have so far 
implemented basic matrix operation functions such as determinant, inverse, echelon form and addition, subtraction as well as multiplication
I will add more functions into it.

## Demo
The project now is still far from being finished. There are still tons of functions to be implemented. The current version has very limited functionalities. Here is a screenshot of the demo,

</div>

Find echelon function and find reduced echelon function have been implemented, but due to some bugs, they are not included in the demo. This repo contains the PC version of the project rather than andorid.
